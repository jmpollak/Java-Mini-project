## Project Assignment

### List of requirements

#### 1. Welcome Screen (20%)

1. (10%) Your program has a welcome screen displaying
   a game title.

2. (10%) Create a Start button. After clicking the
   start button, the game  should start.

#### 2. Question Display (20%)

1. (15%) After started, your game should display
   questions one at a time. Each question appears with
   four possible answers, like the one shown in Fig. 1
   above (i.e., use JButton).

2. (5%) A quiz session should have at least 10
   questions.

#### 3. Game Flow (25%)

1. (20%) Show whether the player’s answer is
   Correct / Incorrect. Once player selects one option
   (clicks on one button), game immediately checks if it’s
   correct. If correct, show “correct” on the screen;
   otherwise,show “incorrect” on the screen. Answers must
   be logically and meaningfully validated (i.e. checking
   the correctness of answers).

2. (5%) Move automatically to the next question.

#### 4. Score Tracking (20%)
1. (20%) Keep track of the player’s score. If player’s answer is correct, give
   scores to the player; otherwise, give some other scores to the player.
   The scores you give must be logically correct and meaningful (i.e.
   checking the correctness of answers).

#### 5. Results Screen (15%)
1. (10%) At the end if no more questions, show a Results
   Screen with finalscore and the player’s nickname.

2. (5%) At the end of the quiz, offer a Play Again
   button to restart and back to welcome screen.

### Extra Features and Extra Credit (25%)

#### 1. Question Categories (5%)
1. Create multiple categories for player to choose
   from on the welcome screen (such as Test preparation
   for java, DMV knowledge test question bank, other
   subjects such as History, Sports...etc.)

#### 2. Timer per Question (5%)
1. Set up a timer and define a time limitation that
   the player must answer before selecting one option.
   If the player does not select an answer in time, mark
   incorrect without points and go to the next question.

#### 3. Player Name (5%)
1. Ask players to enter their nicknames in a textfield.
   Show the name on game screen. Your program should handle
   the case when a name is not provided.

#### 4. Logic Behind the Questions (5%)
1. Questions bank reaches at least 100 questions, and
   every time the program will pick different question
   based on scientific way (pick randomly, tree structure
   to organize questions, or other algorithms you prefer.)

#### 5. Animated Feedback (5%)
1. Change label color (e.g., green for correct, red for
   wrong.)

2. Animations on display throughout the whole game.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. User-Friendly GUI:
1. Layout must be neat, readable, and visually appealing.

#### 2. Code Structure:
1. Use classes (e.g., MainClass, GameEngine, GameFrame
   ...etc) with good separation of concerns.

#### 3. Data Structures:
1. Store questions in an ArrayList<Question>
   (or another suitable structure).

#### 4. Robustness:
1. Program should not crash when a player enters
   unexpected input.
